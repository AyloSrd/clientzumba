# Cöde, seamless coding school experience

Cöde, is a learning platform that provides a connected integrated development environment for teachers and students for live coding lessons. 
Additionally, it can be used to stream coding sessions.

Each lesson is assigned to a specific socket.io room and has threfore its own chat.
The text editors and browsers in each room are connected & sunchronized. Students can pause at any time the code stream from the teacher and play and experiment with it at their own pace and convenance. Specific parts of the lessons can be saved at any time.

WebRTC technology allows the classroom to communicate via video.

The front-end part of Cöde is built with the following technologies:
	create-react-app,
	axios,
    codemirror,
	react-codemirror2
    peerjs,
	react-router,
    socket.io-client
